//What is the set cover problem?
//Given a collection of sets S={S1, ..., Sm} and a universal set U = {1,...,n} that contains all of the elements
//find the minimum number of sets that will include all of the elements 
//in the universal set

//Used https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-sufficient-team/description/
//as a starting point
//This is an instance of the set cover problem since given a list of required skills ( universal set U = {1,...,n})
//and people with some of those skills (set of some or all of those skills S={S1, ..., Sm}) , you want to figure out the 
//smallest number of people you have to hire to have all of skills.

    //this linear programming problem
